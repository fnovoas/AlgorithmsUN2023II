Comments in Python are created by using the pound symbol (`# Insert Text Here`). Including a `#` in a line of code will comment out anything that follows it."

The `round()` function will round a number to a specified number of the decimal points (the default is $0$). Calling `max()` or `min()` on a collection of numbers will return, respectively, the maximum or minimum value in the collection. Calling `sum()` on a collection of numbers will add them all up. If you're not familiar with how collections of values in Python work, don't worry! We will cover collections in-depth in the next section. \n",

A `while` loop will iterate until a certain condition has been met. If at any point after an iteration that condition is no longer satisfied, the loop terminates. A `for` loop will iterate over a sequence of values and terminate when the sequence has ended. You can instead include conditions within the `for` loop to decide whether it should terminate early or you could simply let it run its course."

It contains methods for sampling from many different probability distributions, some of which are covered in the [random variables lecture](https://www.quantopian.com/lectures/random-variables) in the Quantopian lecture series. In this case we draw $N = 100$ random samples from a normal distribution with mean $1.01$ and standard deviation $0.03$. We treat these as the daily percentage returns of our asset and take the cumulative product of these samples to get the current price.\n",

In this case we have a special case of a matrix that we call a vector. While there is a matrix object in NumPy we will be doing everything using NumPy arrays because they can have dimensions greater than $2$.

In this lecture, we will cover how to use the `Series` and `DataFrame` objects to handle data. These objects have a strong integration with NumPy, covered elsewhere in the [lecture series](http://www.quantopian.com/lectures#Introduction-to-NumPy), allowing us to easily do the necessary statistical and mathematical calculations that we need for finance."

Both of these so-called solutions take into account *future data* that was not available at the time of the data points that we are trying to fill. In the case of using the mean or the median, these summary statistics are calculated by taking into account the entire time series. Backward filling is equivalent to saying that the price of a particular security today, right now, tomorrow's price. This also makes no sense. These two options are both examples of look-ahead bias, using data that would be unknown or unavailable at the desired time, and should be avoided.\n",

        "\n",
        "Like `Series`, `DataFrames` can hold multiple types of data, but `DataFrames` are 2-dimensional objects, unlike `Series`. Each `DataFrame` has an index and a columns attribute, which we will cover more in-depth when we start actually playing with an object. The index attribute is like the index of a `Series`, though indices in pandas have some extra features that we will unfortunately not be able to cover here. If you are interested in this, check out the [pandas documentation](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.18.1/advanced.html) on advanced indexing. The columns attribute is what provides the second dimension of our `DataFrames`, allowing us to combine named columns (all `Series`), into a cohesive object with the index lined-up.\n",
        "\n",
        "We can create a `DataFrame` by calling `pandas.DataFrame()` on a dictionary or NumPy `ndarray`. We can also concatenate a group of pandas `Series` into a `DataFrame` using `pandas.concat()`."

Also do not assume that because a distribution or trend used to be true, it is still true. In general much more sophisticated and careful validation is required to test whether models hold. Plots are mainly useful when initially deciding how your models should work."
